<p> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines or software capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and adapting to new situations. AI technologies are designed to mimic cognitive functions associated with human intelligence.
